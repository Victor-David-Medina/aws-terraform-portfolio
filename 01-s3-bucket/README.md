# Phase 01: S3 Bucket - Your First Terraform Resource

> **Problem:** You need a centralized, tagged storage bucket managed entirely through code. No ClickOps.

## What This Deploys

| Resource | Purpose | Monthly Cost |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `aws_s3_bucket` | Object storage with environment tagging | $0 (Free Tier) |

## Architecture

```
Terraform CLI
    ↓
  [AWS Provider v5.x]
    ↓
  [S3 Bucket: vdm-dm-terraform]
    └── Tags: Environment=dev, Project=VDM-Cloud-Ops, ManagedBy=Terraform
```

## Key Decisions

- **Explicit provider version constraint** (`~> 5.0`) to prevent breaking changes from unexpected upgrades
- **Consistent tagging** so every resource gets `Environment`, `Project`, and `ManagedBy` from day one
- **Single region** (`us-east-1`) for cost and Free Tier coverage

## What I Learned

1. **Terraform init/plan/apply lifecycle.** The mental model of "preview before you change anything" comes from the same discipline as double-entry accounting: verify before you commit.
2. **Resource tagging as operational hygiene.** Tags aren't decoration. In production, they drive cost allocation, access policies, and incident triage.
3. **Provider versioning matters.** Pinning `~> 5.0` means "any 5.x but never 6.0." One unversioned `terraform init` in prod can ruin your weekend.

## Deploy

```bash
cd 01-s3-bucket

# Initialize (downloads the AWS provider)
terraform init

# Preview (shows exactly what will be created)
terraform plan

# Deploy (creates the S3 bucket)
terraform apply

# Verify in AWS Console or CLI
aws s3 ls | grep vdm
```

## Cleanup

```bash
# Destroy (bucket must be empty first)
terraform destroy
```

> **Note:** If the bucket contains objects, empty it first with `aws s3 rm s3://vdm-dm-terraform --recursive` before destroying.
