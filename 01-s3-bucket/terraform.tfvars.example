# terraform.tfvars.example — Phase 01: S3 State Bucket
# Copy to terraform.tfvars and customize before running terraform apply.
#
# NOTE: This phase uses hardcoded values in main.tf (no variables.tf).
# To make it configurable, extract these into variables:
#
# aws_region  = "us-east-1"        # AWS region for the S3 bucket
# bucket_name = "vdm-dm-terraform" # Must be globally unique
# environment = "dev"              # Used in resource tags
# project_name = "VDM-Cloud-Ops"   # Used in resource tags
#
# For now, edit main.tf directly to change the bucket name or region.
